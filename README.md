Approach:
    In developing the property rental platform, I utilized a JSON file to manage property details efficiently. This approach simplified data handling by using static JSON data for properties, which allowed for quick access and manipulation without needing a complex backend setup. The development started with setting up a React application using Create React App and a clear folder structure to manage components, pages, and styles. Core features such as property listings and booking management were implemented first, followed by additional functionalities like a cart, checkout process, filter bar, favorites, user profiles, and reviews. User authentication was integrated to handle secure logins and manage user profiles. The platform was designed with responsiveness in mind to ensure it performs well across various devices.

Tech Stack Details:
  React : Used to build the user interface, leveraging React’s component-based architecture to create reusable components and manage state with hooks.
  React Router: Facilitated navigation between different pages, such as property details and user profiles.
  CSS: Applied for styling the application, using traditional CSS files for component-specific styles.
  JSON: Utilized for storing and managing property details. The JSON file serves as a static data source, simplifying data management and allowing for quick 
        updates.

Additional Notes :
  Feature Integration: The platform includes comprehensive features such as a cart and checkout process, a filter bar for search refinements, favorites for 
                       saving preferred properties, and user profiles with review functionality.
  User Authentication: Ensures secure user access and management of personal information and bookings.
  Responsiveness: The application is designed to be functional and visually appealing across various devices and screen sizes.
  Reviews: Added to provide user feedback on properties, enhancing the platform’s interactivity and credibility.
  JSON Data: The JSON file is used for property details, making it easy to update and manage property information without a backend database.
  Deployment: For deployment, I used the  Netlify, which offers efficient hosting and easy scaling.
